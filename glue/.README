# Glue-Based Framework for Counting Insert, Upsert, and MERGE INTO Calls

## Overview

This framework is designed to help you identify the number of calls for insert, upsert, and MERGE INTO operations in your data processing workflows.

You can access the code for this framework on GitHub at the following link: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ad1happy2go/hudi-examples/tree/main/glue).

## Process

The process involves three main steps:

### 1. S3 Calls Benchmarking Data Generation

This step is responsible for generating the data required for merge and upsert operations. It's a crucial part of the benchmarking process as it provides the data needed for subsequent analysis.

### 2. S3 Calls Benchmarking Job

In this step, you can execute the code for which benchmarking needs to be conducted. To initiate the benchmarking process, you will need to provide the following information:

- **Table Name:** Specify the table name you want to analyze.
- **Spark Bundle JAR:** Provide the path to the Spark bundle JAR file you wish to use for benchmarking.

### 3. S3 Calls Benchmarking Code

This code will be

## Usage

1. Clone the GitHub repository: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ad1happy2go/hudi-examples).

2. Navigate to the `glue` directory in the repository to access the code for this framework.

3. Follow the instructions in the code to configure and run the benchmarking job. Make sure to provide the required table name and the path to the Spark bundle JAR.
